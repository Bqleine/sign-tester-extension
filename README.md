# Sign Tester
Simple browser extension to play around with Minecraft signs

This extension helps you easily check whether your translations fit on in-game signs by enabling you to preview them in real time.
If you are using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com), you can directly import the current string.

Note: Characters not present in the extended ascii table are not currently supported but may be added in the future.

### Installation

The extension is available [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sign-tester/jpagfkdglihdggbglcfimeadlooghiid) and [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/sign-tester/)
